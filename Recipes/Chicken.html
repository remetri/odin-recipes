       <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>These seasoned baked chicken breasts always turn out tender, juicy, and perfect every time with this easy 5-ingredient recipe. Adding some chicken broth to the delicious pan drippings creates a flavorful sauce to serve with the chicken.</p>

       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       
       <ul>
       <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
       <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth or water</li>
       </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

       <ol>

        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
       </ol>
